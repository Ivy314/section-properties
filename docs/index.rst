Documentation
=============

``sectionproperties`` is a python package for the analysis of arbitrary
cross-sections using the finite element method. ``sectionproperties``
can be used to determine section properties to be used in structural
design and visualise cross-sectional stresses resulting from
combinations of applied forces and bending moments.

A list of the current features of the package and implementation goals
for future releases can be found in the
`README <https://github.com/robbievanleeuwen/section-properties/tree/master/README.md>`__
file on GitHub.
