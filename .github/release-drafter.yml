  ## ‚≠ê Highlights

  - Get significant performance improvements for large meshes by using the `pardiso`
    solver, see installation docs [here](https://sectionproperties.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#installing-pardiso-solver).
    Further performance gains with the introduction of `numba`, both thanks to @TLCFEM.
  - Vastly increased the number of tests, including 19 extra validation tests from
    Pilkey (2002), three of which can be found in the [examples](https://sectionproperties.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#validation).
  - Added benchmark tests to aid performance improvements.
  - Rhino methods are now support in python 3.10 and 3.11.
